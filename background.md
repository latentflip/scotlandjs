Nought to real-time multiplayer game in 16 hours

Background

At a recent hack-weekend, a team of 3 built a real-time, massively multi-player game in 16 hours using Backbone, websockets with Pusher, Rails and lots of Red Bull. On top of all that, the game was based on Shakespeare’s Macbeth!

Hear about how we built the game, how event-driven programming helped make application modular and quick to build, and why WebSockets are awesome. And as a bonus feature, learn why WebSockets will quickly drive you insane.
              
  * There won’t be much code in this talk, but I will do a short code-based intro to websockets/Pusher for people who haven’t seen them before. The majority of the talk will be split between architecture (the event-driven stuff), and how that affected the way we built the game.
  * It will be technical, but also quite light-hearted (dare I say a little bit funny?) as there are quite a few fun anecdotes from the weekend about websockets driving us mental.
  * I have previously blogged about the experience at Culture Hack where this game was written (http://blog.latentflip.com/post/22215449880/shakey-technical) just to give you an idea of where I am coming from.
