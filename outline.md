# Hello

Good morning. My name is Philip Roberts, and I want to tell you a story about a multiplayer game I built with two other people in this room, Jim who is speaking later today, and Rory Fitzpatrick (who's in the audience?).

This game was built using websockets, which I think will be interesting to you all.

The game is also based around people, who are not online, but are in the same room as each other, reciting lines of Shakespeare - which I hope will inspire you all to experiment with [...]

This game was also built in a very short space of time, 16 hours in fact, which made me learn a few things about building JavaScript applications, which I want to share with you. 

# Culture Hacking

## notes
To give you a little background, Culture Hack Scotland is a hack weekend where a room of developers are given access to a heap of cultural data, and they try to build interesting, useful, fun and beautiful things from it. 

This year the data included things like, the energy consumption of some of edinburgh university's buildings every half hour for an entire year; and all the event information for this years Fringe. But the dataset that caught our eye was a fully marked up XML copy of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
